How much volume would be necessary to filter to detect 100 particles/L in a drinking water sample using Pyr-GC/MS. 
LOQ for Pyr-GC/MS is 1 - 10 ug (total).
Average mass of 1-10 um particle in drinking water is 3.14e-06 ug.
```{r}
average_particle_mass_dw <- 3.14e-06 #ug
actual_LOQ_mass <- 1 #ug
target_LOQ_vol <- 100 #particles/L
target_LOQ_mass <- average_particle_mass_dw  * target_LOQ_vol #ug/L
volume_required =  actual_LOQ_mass / target_LOQ_mass
paste(round(volume_required,1), "L")
```
